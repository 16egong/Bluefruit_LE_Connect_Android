<p>The Controller module streams sensor data from your iOS device to Bluefruit LE over UART at a frequency of 10Hz.  Activation of a switch will begin sending relevant data.  Each packet sent begins with single byte char “!” (0x21) followed by a single byte char initial, and sensor data encoded as float values of 4 byte length</p>
<br>
<li>Quaternion sends iOS Device Motion data to describe device attitude.  This data is derived from Accelerometer, Gyro, and Magnetometer readings.</li>
Format: [ ‘!’ ] [ ‘Q’ ] [ float x ] [ float y ] [ float z ] [ float w ]
<br>
<br>
<li>Accelerometer sends raw accelerometer data
Format: [ ‘!’ ] [ ‘A’ ] [ float x ] [ float y ] [ float z ]
<br>
    <br>
<li>Gyro sends raw gyroscope data as:</li>
Format: [ ‘!’ ] [ ‘G’ ] [ float x ] [ float y ] [ float z ]
<br>
<br>
<li>Magnetometer sends raw magnetometer data which is uncalibrated and does not account for interference from source device.</li>
Format: [ ‘!’ ] [ ‘M’ ] [ float x ] [ float y ] [ float z ]
<br>
<br>
<li>Location sends GPS data and requires user permission before initial use.</li>
Format: [ ‘!’ ] [ ‘L’ ] [ float latitude ] [ float longitude ] [ float altitude ]
<br>

The Control Pad function provides a familiar momentary button interface for common control scenarios.  Data is sent on the press and release of each button.  Each packet consists of 4 bytes, each representing a char value.  The first two chars identify the packet as a button message, the third specifies a button, and the fourth signifies either a press or release.  Example:

Button 4 pressed:  [ ‘!’ ] [ ‘B’ ] [ ‘4’ ] [ ‘1’ ]
Button 4 released: [ ‘!’ ] [ ‘B’ ] [ ‘4’ ] [ ‘0’ ]
<br>
<br>
Note: Any activated sensor data streams will continue while using the Control Pad.
